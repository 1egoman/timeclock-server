    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Invoices are a pain, especially for freelance developers. From calculating
      the amount of hours that you've put into a project, to creating the actual
      invoice and doing design work, most developers would rather do
      something else. Wouldn't you love to get rid of the process?

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Easily track the time you work on a project with <code>waltz</code>. Before
        you start your work for the day, be sure to <code>waltz in</code>. Need to
        run a few errands or get out of the house? Run <code>waltz out</code>. Too
        lazy for that dance? Instead, run <code>waltz watch</code> to listen
        for changes and auto-clock you in or out. In addition to an invoice for
        the client, you also get work-time metrics for yourself.

      <h2>Paycheck time</h2>
      <p>
        Time to get paid? Push up your latest changes, and visit
        <code>http://waltzapp.co/username/repo</code>. Don't like
        what you see? Open up <code>.timecard.json</code> within the project, and change
        <code>reportFormat</code> to any of <a
        href="//github.com/waltz-app/themes">our themes</a>, or make <a
        href="//github.com/waltz-app/docs/blob/master/make-a-theme.md">your own</a>. After pushing up your changes, take a look at your
        new invoice. Was that hard?

          Provide a name, a tagline, and a template, and Waltz will do the rest. Don't

          Because invoices are stored with your code, easily diff invoices across branches to
          quickly determine the time spent on individual features.

        <h4>Collaborative</h4>
        <p>
          Because we integrate with pre-existing codebases, the collaborative workflow
          one uses when working on a project works across invoices in a similar
          manner.

          When your data is in your hands, you can ensure what should stay private will.
          Should you ever want to migrate data to another service, it's easily accessible
          and versioned along with your code.
